# vue-library

This is another version of my [original library app](https://clumsynite.github.io/js-library/). You can see the code [here](https://github.com/Clumsynite/js-library) 

There's almost no difference in features between both links, except this one uses a framework called [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Getting-Started).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
