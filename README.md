# vue-library

## Introduction

This is another version of my [original library app](https://clumsynite.github.io/js-library/). You can see the code [here](https://github.com/Clumsynite/js-library) 

There's almost no difference in features between both links, except this one uses a framework called [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Getting-Started).

This app uses Browser's localStorage to keep record of the added books. 

### Limitations

- User will have to access the same browser in order to keep track of Library. As, localStorage is used, using another browser will show an empty library.
